# Connect 4 in C

Play Connect 4 against a BOT in the console!  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using pure C, designed to run in a terminal or command prompt.

I created this project to revisit my C knowledge, since I'm primarily a frontend developer and I'm interested in game programming.
I wanted to start small, and soon realized the game could get a bit boring.
With the help of AI, I made it more fun: use the left and right arrows to select a column and press Enter to drop your piece.
The AI acts like a human player, trying to block you and win.
